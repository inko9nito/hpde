# Notes for Claude working in this repo

## Downloading image attachments from GitHub issues

`curl` on a `github.com/user-attachments/assets/<uuid>` URL is blocked by
the remote-session egress proxy (403). To fetch such an image:

1. Call `WebFetch` on the `github.com/user-attachments/...` URL. It
   won't return the image, but it reports the 302 redirect target — a
   signed `github-production-user-asset-*.s3.amazonaws.com` URL. That
   host **is** allowed by the proxy.
2. `curl -sL "<the signed S3 URL>" -o /path/in/scratchpad/file.jpeg`
3. `Read` the local file to see the image.

Do not try to route around the block by other means; do not disable TLS
or unset `HTTPS_PROXY`.
